We are an independent rescue whose members- all volunteers- have over 25 years of combined experience in the rescue and rehabilitation of dogs in need. Our members’ reasons for being in rescue are varied from being compassionate lifetime dog lovers to having bought that “cute little puppy in the window” only to have our hearts broken when they became ill from being born to sick mothers kept in deplorable conditions. Or when we sadly discovered that the “home raised” pups were, in reality, puppy mill puppies. Whatever brought us to BisB, we stay because we have seen our hard work and dedication pay off in changing the lives of so many deserving dogs."
